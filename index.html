        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sustainability♻️️</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Jennie Tran and I am currently a 4th year 
        Sustainability major at the University of California, Riverside. I am passionate
        about raising awareness for climate change and playing an active role in my community to 
        advocate sustainable practices. I had originally been a Biology major but I felt that 
        Sustainability struck a chord with my true desires of wanting to help the planet. With Biology,
        I did not feel that my studies would yield a clear path towards being able to promote sustainable 
        practices. However, through my studies in Sustainability, I have gained first hand experience in learning
        what constitutes a sustainable measure. Ethics, practicality, and plausibility all play major roles
        in establishing long term plans and actions that can be disseminated and encouraged in our communities.
         I plan to undertake an internship sponsored by Transportation Services. With a focus on sustainability, 
         this internship will allow me to apply what I have learned throughout my studies and truly develop 
         something that could be beneficial for UC Riverside and its surrounding community. Following graduation
         and the end of the internship, I hope to carry on my experiences into the workforce.
        <br><br>
        I work for UC Riverside's Transportation Services as an Event Junior Staff member. 
        The Junior Staff position is equivalent to a student supervisor who oversees some of the daily tasks
        that the full time staff do. When the full time staff have meetings that pull them away from being
        available for the other student workers, I am able to be the acting lead and carry on business. My duties entail 
        cashing in/out kiosk workers for their shifts, organizing and maintaining event signage, coordinating pilot studies such as 
        My Commute, and acting as a general student manager. I have worked for Transportation Services for over 3 years
        and gained invaluable experience not only as part-time worker but also as a member of the UC Riverside community.
         I have had the opportunity to meet many people not only at UC Riverside but also UC Merced as well who all contribute to making UC Riverside such a great campus.
        Being able to help visitors, prospective students, and distinguished guests has given me a sense of pride knowing that 
        the high quality customer service that I am providing to them will leave a significant impression of UC Riverside. 
        Transportation Services has truly been a one of a kind experience that allowed me to develop the leadership skills 
        that I take pride of myself for having. I wish to carry on this learning throughout my career and I hope to instill the
        same passion and drive into the future generations of our society.
        <br><br>
        Some of my hobbies include dancing to Korean Pop music (KPOP), spending time with my boyfriend and family, and going to Disneyland.
